# iNaturalist to CAMS User Guide

The iNaturalist to CAMS synchroniser will update the CAMS weed app with new observations from iNaturalist. 
For each project, it will synchronize all observations with specific taxa (including descendents) from a particular place.
If your project is not already configured for synchronisation talk to your project coordinator or email office@econet.nz.

This guide assumes you already have an iNaturalist account and that a project has already been set up to synchronise the taxa and place you are entering. The guide covers:

1. how to add observations to iNaturalist with data that is useful for the CAMS application
2. how to update existing observations in iNaturalist so that the CAMS weed data is updated

## Adding observations to iNaturalist

All observations (with a specific taxa and place) will be synchronised, whether they are added to the `Weed Management Aotearoa NZ` or not. 
However, adding the observation to the `Weed Management Aotearoa NZ` project and filling in relevant observation fields provides information that is useful for controlling the weed.

### Joining the `Weed Management Aotearoa NZ` project

Before adding an observation to the `Weed Management Aotearoa NZ` project, you'll need to join the project.

Note that this can only be performed on the browser version, not on the mobile app.

Open the [Join Weed Management Aoetearoa NZ Project page](https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/weed-management-aotearoa-nz/join), read the project page and select the `Yes, I want to join` button. 

### Adding a new observation to the `Weed Management Aotearoa NZ` project

If you're not familiar with adding observations to iNaturalist see [this guide](https://www.inaturalist.org/pages/add-an-observation-nz). 

Please check the location of the observation is accurate, and update it if necessary. This will help us to find the weed in future.

**Note**: the mobile app does not currently allow you to add other users' observations to projects. You'll need to use the browser version to add other users' observations. 

#### Using the Mobile app

When adding a new observation, click on the `Add to project(s)` option and select the `Weed Management Aotearoa NZ` project.

#### Using a Browser

When adding a new observation, select the `Projects` option and add the observation to the `Weed Management Aotearoa NZ` project.

#### Filling in the observation fields

When filling in the fields using a browser, you need to press the `Add` button next to each observation field you wish to set.
Failure to do this will mean that your details are not saved.

##### Weed Details

These fields help us plan and tackle the weed:

<dl>
  <dt>Location details</dt>
  <dd>A short description of the location that is shown on the CAMS map, eg. `under bridge` or `downhill from gate`. The geolocation should guide us to the approximate location.</dd>
  <dt>Area in square meters</dt>
  <dd>The estimated size of the weed patch</dd>
  <dt>Height (m)</dt>
  <dd>The estimated height of the tallest part of the weed, in metres</dd>
  <dt>Height (m)</dt>
  <dd>Plant phenology->most common flowering/fruiting reproductive stage</dd>
  <dt>The most common stage of plant growth</dt>
  <dd>Site difficulty</dd>
  <dt>The estimated difficulty of accessing the weed. Typically, levels 1-3 might be performed by the general public, level 4 by skilled workers, while level 5 typically requires professionals</dt>
  <dd>Effort to control</dd>
  <dt>The estimated time required to control the weed</dt>
</dl>

## FAQ

* Why isn't my observation is not coming through to CAMS?

Firstly, observations are synchronised hourly. You might need to wait if it's less than an hour since you entered it in iNaturalist.

If using the mobile app, note that the observations, and updates, are stored locally and uploaded when your phone has a data connection. Sometimes this can get stuck. 
Try clicking on the home button and then your observations to see if any are currently waiting or being uploaded. 
Check also that your Settings have "Automatic Upload (Auto Sync)" ticked, or invoke a manual upload.
